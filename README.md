# Zhusuan-Oneflow

This work is based on the repo: [Zhusuan-PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/McGrady00H/Zhusuan-PaddlePaddle).

ZhuSuan-Oneflow is a python probabilistic programming library for
**Bayesian deep learning**, which conjoins the complimentary advantages of
Bayesian methods and deep learning. ZhuSuan is built upon
[Oneflow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow). Unlike existing deep learning
libraries, which are mainly designed for deterministic neural networks and
supervised tasks, ZhuSuan-Oneflow provides deep learning style primitives and
algorithms for building probabilistic models and applying Bayesian inference.
The supported inference algorithms include:

* Variational inference with programmable variational posteriors, various
objectives and advanced gradient estimators (SGVB, SWI, etc.).

* Importance sampling for learning and evaluating models, with programmable
proposals.

* MCMC samplers: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with parallel chains, and
Stochastic Gradient MCMC (sgmcmc).
